st.caption("Time deposits are the main source of income for a bank. Time deposits are cash investments held at financial institutions. Your money is invested for an agreed rate of interest over a certain period or period. Telephone marketing campaigns are still one of the most effective ways to reach people. However, they require a large investment of hiring a call center to actually run this campaign. That's why it's so important to identify customers who are most likely to convert first so they can be targeted specifically through calls. The data relates to a direct marketing campaign (phone calls) from a Portuguese banking institution. The purpose of classification is to predict whether a client will subscribe to a time deposit.")
